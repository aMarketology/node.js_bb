## 🪙 The Three Currencies

### 1. Fan Coins (FC) — Entertainment Currency
**Purpose:** Virtual currency for entertainment and social gaming experiences.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Purchased directly with fiat currency (USD)
- ✅ Used for fun play, social contests, and practice entries
- ❌ **Cannot be withdrawn or redeemed for cash**
- ❌ Never used for real-money prize contests

**Legal Classification:**
- Virtual entertainment currency (like arcade tokens)
- Similar to in-game currency in mobile games
- No redemption value = no gambling risk

**Use Cases:**
- Practice fantasy rosters before using $BB
- Social competitions with friends
- Entertainment-only game modes
- Purchasing cosmetic features or analytics upgrades

**Pricing Example:**
```
$10 USD  → 10,000 FC
$50 USD  → 55,000 FC (10% bonus)
$100 USD → 120,000 FC (20% bonus)
```
